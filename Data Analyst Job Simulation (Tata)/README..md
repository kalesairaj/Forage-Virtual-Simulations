# Tata Virtual Data Analyst Program – Forage

This folder contains my submission for the **Tata – Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights** Virtual Experience Program hosted on Forage.

## 🚀 What I Did

Over the course of this simulation, I stepped into the shoes of a data analyst, solving real-world business problems through visual storytelling, cleaning data, and communicating insights.

### 🧠 Task 1: Strategic Business Questions
Framed executive-level questions for:
- **CEO** (e.g., highest/lowest selling countries, product performance)
- **CMO** (e.g., customer retention, bulk purchases, monthly trends)

### 📊 Task 2: Choosing the Right Charts
Answered scenario-based questions by recommending suitable visuals like:
- Bar Charts
- Pie Charts
- Line Graphs  
with justifications based on the scenario.

### 🧼 Task 3: Data Cleaning & Dashboard
- Cleaned the raw dataset using **Excel**
- Built an interactive **Tableau dashboard** to answer CEO & CMO questions
- Focused on clarity, impact, and insight delivery

### 🎥 Task 4: Final Presentation
Created a short presentation video explaining:
